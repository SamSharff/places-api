# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# place = Place.new(name: "Disney World", address: "Orlando, FL")
# place.save

# place = Place.new(name: "Funtown", address: "Scarborough, ME")
# place.save

# place = Place.new(name: "Splashtown", address: "Scarborough, ME")
# place.save

# place = Place.new(name: "Museum of Science", address: "Boston, MA")
# place.save

# place = Place.new(name: "Canobie Lake Park", address: "Salem, NH")
# place.save
